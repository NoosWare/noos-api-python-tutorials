# II. Call services

## II.1. List avaible services

The curl command would be:

```bash
curl -H "User-Token: <username>" -H "Accept-Token: <password>" https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/available_services
```

The output is in JSON and is a bit ugly in the terminal.
If you have setup and activate your environment as explained in the previous section, you
can add ` | python -m json.tool` to beautify the JSON received.

## II.2. Call services

### II.2.a Computer vision services

Here is the list of computer vision services that we offer:

- face_recognition
- face_detection
- human_detection
- qr_recognition
- age_detection
- gender_detection
- face_expression

All this services can be called with POST request, the form must of type `multipart-data`
and contain a binary image field.

An example for face_detection would be in bash:

```bash
curl -H "User-Token: <username>" -H "Accept-Token: <password>" https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/available_services
```

If we want to translate this to python, it would be:

```python
import requests

# Create the authentication header
headers = {
    "User-Token": <user>,
    "Accept-Token": <password>
}

# The form to submit
files = {
    "filename": ("image.jpg", open("image.jpg", "rb"))
}

# Request the service to the platform
url = "https://demo.noos.cloud:9001/face_detection"
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
# basic printing
print(response.json())
# pretty printing
import json
print(json.dumps(response.json(), indent=2, sort_keys=True))
```

**Note:** Do not forget to change the above code to match your
username/password and your image filename.
