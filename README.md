# NOOS Python tutorials

There is no API developped for Python at the moment. But this is fairly easy
to use without it as you will see in the following tutorials.

Python2 will reach its end of support on the 1st January of 2020, so we are
supporting only Python3 in this tutorial. If you are motivated to create a
python2 tutorial, feel free to open a pull request, we'll be happy to help
you.
